Welcome to the 20th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Reverse-Engineering NES Tetris to add Hard Drop][tetris-hard-drop]

![NES Tetris with Hard Drop and Ghost Piece](tetris-hard-drop.gif) _NES Tetris
with Hard Drop and Ghost Piece_

A [blog post][tetris-hard-drop] describing the process of reverse-engineering
the rendering and input-handling logic in the NES version of Tetris, and using
a [rust embedded domain-specific language][tetris-hard-drop-dsl-example] to
make a [patching tool][tetris-hard-drop-patch-tool] that generates code (6502
machine code) to add hard drop (instantly dropping the current piece) and to
render a ghost piece (the dotted outline showing where the current piece will
land).

The patching tool uses the crate
[mos6502_assembler][tetris-hard-drop-assembler] to specify 6502 assembly in
rust and generate machine code. Many of the reverse-engineering experiments
were done using [this rust NES emulator][tetris-hard-drop-nes-emulator].  The
result is available as an [IPS Patch][tetris-hard-drop-ips-patch].
