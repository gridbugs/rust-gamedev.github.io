Welcome to the 20th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Orbital Decay][orbital-decay]

_Orbital Decay gameplay_

[Orbital Decay][orbital-decay] by [@stevebob][] is an
[open-source][orbital-decay-source] turn-based tactical roguelike with a focus
on ranged combat.  Deal enough damage to enemies to get through their armour
without breaching the hull of the station, or risk being pulled into the void.
It was made for the [7 Day Roguelike 2021][7drl-2021] game jam.

Traverse a procedurally-generated space station to reach the fuel bay on the
5th floor. Choose your weapons and upgrades wisely to make it past the
station's former crew - now a horde of ravenous undead.

Read more about Orbital Decay on its [development blog][orbital-decay-blog].
